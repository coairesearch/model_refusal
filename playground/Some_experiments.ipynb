      " that the 2024 Swedish General Election took place on September 8th, 2024. The election was significant because it resulted in a hung parliament, where no single party had a majority. This led to the formation of a coalition government. The main parties involved in the coalition were the Social Democrats (S), the Greens (MP), the Left Party (V), and the Liberals (L). Together, they formed a left-wing coalition. The election also saw a strong performance by the Sweden Democrats (SD), who became the largest party in terms of votes but not in terms of seats. This election was notable for the high voter turnout, which was 84.2%. It was the first time in over 70 years that the Sweden Democrats had the most votes, but they couldn't form a government on their own, leading to the hung parliament scenario. The election campaign focused on issues like climate change, economic policies, and immigration, with the Sweden Democrats emphasizing their anti-immigration stance\n"
